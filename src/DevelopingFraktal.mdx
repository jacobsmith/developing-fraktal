# Developing Fraktal

Fraktal is a pattern-matching library for JavaScript. It adds support for some syntax that is not normally seen in JavaScript, namely the ability to execute different blocks of code when calling the same function. It is a moderate to advanced level library - there are obviously much larger and complex packages out there - Fraktal is large enough to be useful in a real application but small enough to implement in a few hours.

## Why pattern matching?

Pattern matching is the abilitiy for function definitions themselves to declare what arguments they accept. Because of this, they can validate the shape or state of data they accept before running any execution. This leads to code that has far fewer conditionals in the code and, as such, is generally easier to reason through. It does take a bit of time to understand how to organize code utilizing pattern matching. Pattern matching also lends itself very nicely to functional programming styles as functions are the fundamental building blocks of functional languages. This is in contrast to object-oriented languages where the object is the most basic building block.

## What you'll be creating

The end result is a package that provides pattern matching ability. It will also explore Proxy objects, passing functions as arguments, data validation, and sybmols.

Example:

<Editor example={ example1 } />

As you can see above, calling `test` with different values will execute different functions. Oh, and the code above is interactive - try passing `'456'` as the argument to `app.test` and see the value update.
